# pitching_command
Technical exercise for unnamed Major League Baseball organisation data analyst position.

This project examined fastball command for 5 different pitchers across several years. Approximately 20k lines of data.
Command was defined as ability for a pitcher to place pitches where they intend to place them. Standard errors of location were looked at in density plots.
